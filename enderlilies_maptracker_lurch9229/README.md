Logic for the Verboten domain that involves going through blight is currently set to needing mask, or having 3 priestess' wishes, spellbound anklet 150+hp (this includes health boosts from Soiled Prayer Beads and Royal Aegis Curio (not the unused health relic)) and 5 relic slots, or having 150+hp, holy water, spellbound anklet and 6 relic slots along with movement needed to each check or 120P guardians wings (dodge upgrade) and dash (from Julius) with 3 wishes.

Logic to get through the Abyss Hell Run is set to needing 300+hp, spellbound anklet, ruined witches book, 6 wishes and 7 relic slots. This needs more vigorus testing so please let me know if you find over ways to get through gauntlet. Thanks.
